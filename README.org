Sync iCalendar events to org-mode files while preserving your notes.

** Installation

This tool requires both this Python package and the [[https://github.com/theophilusx/icsorg][icsorg npm package]]:

1. Install the icsorg npm package:

#+begin_src bash
npm install -g icsorg
#+end_src

2. Install the Python package:

#+begin_src bash
pip install ics-to-org
#+end_src

** Usage

After installation, you can use the command-line tool:

#+begin_src bash
sync_calendar --ics-url "https://outlook.office365.com/..." \
              --org-file "meetings.org" \
              --author "Your Name" \
              --email "your.email@example.com" \
              --days-forward 14 \
              --days-backward 7
#+end_src

Command-line options:

| Option           | Description                                                 |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| --ics-url        | URL of the iCalendar feed (required)                        |
| --org-file       | Path to the org file to update (required)                   |
| --author         | Your name, used in the org file (required)                  |
| --email          | Your email, used in the org file (required)                 |
| --days-forward   | Number of days forward to fetch (default: 7)                |
| --days-backward  | Number of days backward to fetch (default: 0)               |
| --no-format-dates | Disable the formatting of all-day and multi-day events      |

By default, the script formats all-day events as =<2025-04-27 Sun>= (without time)
and multi-day events as =<2025-04-27 Sun>--<2025-04-28 Mon>= (inclusive dates).
If you prefer to keep the raw timestamps with the 00:00 times, use the =--no-format-dates= option.

This script will:

- Fetch the latest calendar data using icsorg for the specified time range
  - Default is 7 days forward and 0 days backward from the current date
  - Customize with --days-forward and --days-backward options
- For each event in your calendar:
  - Update the header, properties, and scheduling from the calendar
  - If the event has a description in the calendar, update the #+begin_agenda #+end_agenda block
  - Preserve any notes you've made outside of the agenda block
  - Format all-day events without time information (unless --no-format-dates is used)
  - Format multi-day events with inclusive end dates (unless --no-format-dates is used)
- For events that are no longer in your calendar, mark them as "CANCELED" but keep them in your file
- Preserve past events without changes
  - Use --days-backward to specify how many days of past events to include for updates
  - Past events beyond this window won't be modified
- Sort all events by their scheduled time

** Testing

These test files cover several important scenarios:

- Meeting with updated title, time, and description
  - Original: "Review WellAdmin/TradV Feed and discuss policy year field"
  - Updated: "UPDATED: Review WellAdmin/TradV Feed Implementation"
  - Time changed from 14:30-15:00 to 14:00-15:00
  - Description updated with more details
  - Your notes are preserved
- Meeting that remains unchanged
  - "Weekly Team Sync" stays the same
  - Your notes are preserved
- New meeting added
  - "New Project Kickoff Meeting" appears in the updated calendar
  - Creates an agenda block from the description
- Meeting that was canceled
  - "Past Meeting That Got Canceled" is no longer in the calendar
  - Marked as "CANCELED" in the org file
  - Your notes are preserved

*How to Use These Test Files*

#+begin_src
python -m pytest
#+end_src

If the test passes, you're good to go! If not, the diff output will show what's
different between the expected and actual output.

These test files should help you verify that the sync script correctly handles
all the scenarios you described, including:

- Updating meeting properties (title, time, location)
- Updating agenda blocks
- Preserving your notes
- Handling canceled meetings
- Adding new meetings
