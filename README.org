Sync ics calendar to an org file while preserving notes.
Code co-written by Claude.

To use this script, save it as sync_calendar.py and run it like this:

#+begin_src 
python3 sync_calendar.py --ics-url "https://outlook.office365.com/..." --org-file "meetings.org" --author "Andy Reagan" --email "me@andyreagan.com"
#+end_src


This script will:

- Fetch the latest calendar data using icsorg
- For each event in your calendar:
  - Update the header, properties, and scheduling from the calendar
  - If the event has a description in the calendar, update the #+begin_agenda #+end_agenda block
  - Preserve any notes you've made outside of the agenda block
- For events that are no longer in your calendar, mark them as "CANCELED" but keep them in your file
- Sort all events by their scheduled time

** Testing

These test files cover several important scenarios:

- Meeting with updated title, time, and description
  - Original: "Review WellAdmin/TradV Feed and discuss policy year field"
  - Updated: "UPDATED: Review WellAdmin/TradV Feed Implementation"
  - Time changed from 14:30-15:00 to 14:00-15:00
  - Description updated with more details
  - Your notes are preserved
- Meeting that remains unchanged
  - "Weekly Team Sync" stays the same
  - Your notes are preserved
- New meeting added
  - "New Project Kickoff Meeting" appears in the updated calendar
  - Creates an agenda block from the description
- Meeting that was canceled
  - "Past Meeting That Got Canceled" is no longer in the calendar
  - Marked as "CANCELED" in the org file
  - Your notes are preserved

*How to Use These Test Files*

#+begin_src 
python -m pytest
#+end_src

If the test passes, you're good to go! If not, the diff output will show what's
different between the expected and actual output.

These test files should help you verify that the sync script correctly handles
all the scenarios you described, including:

- Updating meeting properties (title, time, location)
- Updating agenda blocks
- Preserving your notes
- Handling canceled meetings
- Adding new meetings
